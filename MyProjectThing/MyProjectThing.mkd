Robocar Documentation
===

# Objectives
1. Able to control the Robocar on **any devices** using **WiFi** and **web browser**
2. Able to perform **OTA update** and **firmware reset** on the Robocar
3. Authentication required to enter web server
4. Autonomous Robocar with collision detection
5. IFTTT notifications when Robocar is stucked in autonomous mode
6. Push the total distance moved in manual mode to Adafruit.io

# Prerequisite
## Libraries and Plugins
The following libraries and plugins have to be installed in order to compile and run successfully.

1. [ESP32 Filesystem Uploader](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin) installed, and
   the `data` directory has been uploaded to the ESP32
2. Latest version of [Adafruit_IO_Arduino](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Arduino) library.
   The one in University Linux machines does not have the `get()` method in `AdafruitIO_Feed`
3. Latest version of [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer). The one in
   University Linux machines is outdated. New version introduced several bug fixes and performance
   improvements.

## Hardware
In addition to the *default* Robocar, this project used two **ultrasonic sensors** to improve the reliability
and performance of the autonomous mode. The hardware setup is shown in [here](#hardware-setup).

# Design
## System Specification
| Criteria | Importance |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
| **Software Robustness:** The unPhone should be bootable even if the system update has failed. | Essential |
| **Completeness:** The Robocar should be able to move in both automatic and manual mode. The firmware should be updated to the latest version when the update has successfully completed. The firmware should downgrade to version 1 when firmware reset has successfully completed. | Essential |
| **Security:** Authentication is required to enter the web server. OTA update and firmware reset are performed over HTTPS. | Essential |
| **Network:** The unPhone should be able to scan and connect to any WiFi networks (hidden networks included), provided that the password entered is correct. | Essential |
| **Informative:** The unPhone should be able to publish data to Adafruit.io, and send notifications through IFTTT. | Essential |
| **Hardware Robustness:** The motor, ultrasonic sensors, and unPhone should be fully functioning | Desirable |
| **Automatic:** The Robocar should be able to move randomly in automatic mode, while detecting possible obstacles in its front and back to prevent collision. | Desirable |

# Hardware Setup

# Implementation
talk about how we calculate the distance, and how we got the formula

# Challenges
- Calibration: It is required to experiment with different time values to find the correct value for
               turning the robot 90 degrees at different speed

# Hardware Problems
Below are a list of hardware problems identified during the implementation and testing stage of the
project.

1. **Problem 1**: LED light on the motor driver dims, and a very small beep sound is
   emitted, motor will not move.
   - **Cause**: The power switch of the AA battery case is not sensitive.
   - **Fix**: Press the power switch down, or slightly adjust it to the left or right
   - **Further note**: It is unable to confirm that flashing `BigDemo.ino` will fix this issue.

2. **Problem 2**: LED light does not dim, no beep sound emitted, motor will not move.
   - **Cause**: This problem occurred during the attempt to fix **Problem 1**, after
     flashing BigDemo.ino and the code. It is unable to determine whether it was a
     hardware or a software issue.
   - **Possible Fix**: Flashing `BigDemo.ino` and `MyProjectThing.ino` again.

3. **Problem 3**: Left motor rotates slower than right motor
   - **Possible cause**: The electricity transmitted to the left motor is lower, the problem is
                         most obvious when the motor speed is low.
   - **Mitigation**: The problem could be mitigated by increasing the speed of both motors.
