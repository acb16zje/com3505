# Objectives
1. Able to control the Robocar on **any devices** using **WiFi** and **web server**
2. Able to perform **OTA update** and **firmware reset** on the Robocar
3. **Authentication** required to enter web server
4. **Automatic** Robocar with collision detection
5. **IFTTT notifications** when Robocar is stucked in autonomous mode
6. Push the total distance moved in manual mode to **Adafruit.io**

# Prerequisite
## Libraries and Plugins
The following libraries and plugins have to be installed in order to compile and run successfully.

1. [ESP32 Filesystem Uploader](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin) installed, and
   the `data` directory has been uploaded to the ESP32
2. Latest version of [Adafruit_IO_Arduino](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Arduino) library.
   The one in University Linux machines does not have the `get()` method in `AdafruitIO_Feed`
3. Latest version of [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer). The one in
   University Linux machines is outdated. New version introduced several bug fixes and performance
   improvements.

## Hardware
In addition to the *default* Robocar, this project used two **ultrasonic sensors** to improve the reliability
and performance of the autonomous mode. The hardware setup is shown in [here](#hardware-setup).

# Design
## System Specification
| Criteria | Importance |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------:|
| **Software Robustness:** The unPhone should be bootable even if the system update has failed. | Essential |
| **Completeness:** The Robocar should be able to move in both automatic and manual mode. The firmware should be updated to the latest version when the update has successfully completed. The firmware should downgrade to version 1 when firmware reset has successfully completed. | Essential |
| **Security:** Authentication is required to enter the web server. OTA update and firmware reset are performed over HTTPS. | Essential |
| **Network:** The unPhone should be able to scan and connect to any WiFi networks (hidden networks included), provided that the password entered is correct. | Essential |
| **Informative:** The unPhone should be able to publish data to Adafruit.io, and send notifications through IFTTT. | Essential |
| **Hardware Robustness:** The motor, ultrasonic sensors, and unPhone should be fully functioning | Desirable |
| **Automatic:** The Robocar should be able to move randomly in automatic mode, while detecting possible obstacles in its front and back to prevent collision. | Desirable |

# Implementation
talk about how we calculate the distance, and how we got the formula

## Hardware Setup

## Challenges
- Calibration: It is required to experiment with different time values to find the correct value for
               turning the robot 90 degrees at different speed
- Soldering: solder ultrasonic sensor

# Hardware Problems
Below are a list of hardware problems identified during the implementation and testing stage of the
project.

1. **Problem 1**: LED light on the motor driver dims, and a very small beep sound is
   emitted, motor will not move.
   - **Cause**: The power switch of the AA battery case is not sensitive.
   - **Fix**: Press the power switch down, or slightly adjust it to the left or right
   - **Further note**: It is unable to confirm that flashing `BigDemo.ino` will fix this issue.

2. **Problem 2**: LED light does not dim, no beep sound emitted, motor will not move.
   - **Cause**: This problem occurred during the attempt to fix **Problem 1**, after
     flashing BigDemo.ino and the code. It is unable to determine whether it was a
     hardware or a software issue.
   - **Possible Fix**: Flashing `BigDemo.ino` and `MyProjectThing.ino` again.

3. **Problem 3**: Left motor rotates slower than right motor
   - **Possible cause**: The electricity transmitted to the left motor is lower, the problem is
                         most obvious when the motor speed is low.
   - **Mitigation**: The problem could be mitigated by increasing the speed of both motors.

# Debugging
We have implemented a debugging infrastructure that makes use of macros for easier code debugging.
The variables can be changed from `true` to `false` to enable or disable the function respectively.

`setupDBG`: For printing messages related to the initial setup process.

`netDBG`: For printing messages related to `AsyncWebServer` management.

`otaDBG`: For printing messages in the `doOTAUpdate` method.

`dataDBG`: For printing messages related to Adafruit.io data logging.

`moveDBG`: For printing messages related to the `Movement` control of the Robocar.

# Testing
The system was tested manually to ensure that each feature functioned correctly. This included
running the entire process from start to finish, followed by trying to reproduce the errors to
ensure the error will be handled by the system.

# Conclusions
Functionalities that have been implemented in into the Robocar system:

1. Remotely control the Robocar using PC or mobile phones on web server (**Flexibility**)
2. Send IFTTT notification when the Robocar is stucked during automatic mode (**Informative**)
3. Push the total distance moved of the Robocar in manual mode to Adafruit.io (**Informative**)
4. Authentication required to access the web server pages (**Security**)
5. Check the latest version and download the bin file directly from GitHub over HTTPS (**Security**)
6. Web server that display the status of the device and enable the ability to update or reset the
   firmware remotely (**Flexibility**)
7. The ability to reset the firmware back to version 1 and upgrade to latest version again for
   testing purposes (**Repeatable**)
8. Able to join both visible and hidden WiFi networks using the web server (**Networking**)
