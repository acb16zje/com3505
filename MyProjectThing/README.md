incorporates any other separately advertised adjustments.]

This is email is to give you the provisional marks from your COM3505 work up
to week12 (based on the lab assessment on Friday 2nd November, the exam of
Monday 10th December, the projects lab assessment of Friday 14th November, and
snapshots of your work pushed to GitHub).

My records indicate that your email, name, ucard and username are as follows:

    zjeng1@sheffield.ac.uk Jun Eng 001640322 acb16zje

Also, you were in a lab team with Jia Ng (acb16jhn), and
your usual teaching assistant was Edwin.

If any of this is incorrect please let me know!

Your provisional marks (and feedback summary) are:

    Exam score:  85.3%
    Project:     89.0%
    Lab assmt 1: 93.7%
    Overall:     88.93%

(Note: no adjustments for extenuating circumstances are included here;
they are applied later on as appropriate.)

Feedback on your project work:

    One of the best projects we've seen! This team initially planned on developing
    a robocar and a TV remote together, however, they finally focused on the
    robocar. Besides the robocar basic functions (basic movements, motor, battery
    management), they used two ultrasonic sensors to avoid collisions. Created an
    easy-to-use web interface to control the robocar movements in real time using
    (JS, Jquery, CSS, HTML). Included not only a velocity slider but also an
    autonomous mode button which enable the robocar to move by itself monitoring
    there was still room to advance and avoiding collisions. Finally, they also
    implemented IFTTT to notify the user when the robocar got stuck in an
    autonomous mode.

    Truly excellent work, well done! Worthy of publication on Hackaday or similar.

    Design: detailed and insightful discussion
    Implementation and testing: excellent
    Core functions: full
    Additional functions: excellent work on position recall and positional modelling in general
    Security: comprehensive discussion and implementation
    Code style and comments: excellent
    Did it work in the lab? yes
    Did the firmware compile and load in our automated test suite? yes
    Data collection? collected a large amount of information about runtime performance
    Data analysis? analysed the performance of various subsystems in detail

Below there is a summary of some of the data we hold on your work, for reference.

All the best, and good luck with the rest of your degree!

Lab teaching staff feedback:

lab feedback on 2018-11-26 : Good work! As you both seem to be aiming at completing an amazing project, it would be good to divide the work as much as you can. Because you almost finished assembling the Robocar, it would be good if one of you keeps assembling the TV remote and the other keeps finishing the robocar programming. Keep in mind that at some point you will have to evaluate if the TV remote is doable, but it will be better to submit quality deliverables and good documentation.

lab feedback on 2018-10-15 : Amazing work! You may want to review extra examples to discover more features of the hardware and IDE.

lab feedback on 2018-11-09 : Great work! You completed the lab on time. Have you thought of letting the dot continue from the opposite wall when it reaches a wall?

lab feedback on 2018-10-08 : You did your best to finish most of the lab on time and overcame the problems. Well done!

lab feedback on 2018-10-22 : Good work!

lab feedback on 2018-10-22 : Keep it up! You are working well in the labs and, with more practice, you will be able to deal with more difficult problems. You might want to learn about the OSI model to debug quicker your server and connectivity problems.
